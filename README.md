# Deep Kinematic Cycling Model

A hybrid cycling prediction model that explicitly encodes bicycle kinematics through a kinematic layer to improve trajectory feasibility and robustness against degraded data. The implementation is largely based on [MotionCNN](https://github.com/kbrodt/waymo-motion-prediction-2021).
